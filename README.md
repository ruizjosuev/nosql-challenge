In this assignment, I first imported the establishments data from the provided establishments.json file into a new database called uk_food, confirming the successful import via mongo shell commands. Next, I connected to MongoDB using PyMongo in the NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb notebook, verified the newly created database and the establishments collection, and examined a sample document using pprint. I then inserted a new restaurant record for “Penang Flavours,” updated its BusinessTypeID, and removed all establishments within the Dover Local Authority as requested. Finally, using NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb, I conducted various queries to find establishments based on hygiene scores, rating values, and location proximity, and aggregated data by local authority area to answer the editors’ specific questions.
